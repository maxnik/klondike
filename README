Klondike rules:
(from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klondike_solitaire)

Taking a standard 52-card deck of playing cards (without Jokers) one upturned card
is dealt on the left of the playing area, then six downturned cards (from left to right). 
On top of the downturned cards, an upturned card is dealt on the left-most downturned pile, 
and downturned cards on the rest until all piles have an upturned card. 

The four foundations (light rectangles in the upper right of the figure) are built up by 
suit from Ace to King, and the tableau piles can be built down by alternate colours, and 
partial or complete piles can be moved if they are built down by alternate colors also. 
Any empty piles can be filled with a King or a pile of cards with a King at the top.

Only one card from the remainder of the deck is turned at a time. There is no limit on 
passes through the deck.
